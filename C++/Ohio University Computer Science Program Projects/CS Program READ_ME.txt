All projects found in this directory are from my courses at Ohio University 
during my Computer Science minor.

These are divided up by the name of the project and the focus of them. Many 
of these projects were to learn a specific subject or concept and may not use
some of the most up-to-date practices. For example, while I am quite familiar
with the STL, we are often asked to construct our own containers and template
functions.

Also, we are often provided with partial implementation of programs so we 
have time to focus on the intended subject and so our resulting code may be
graded identically across the class.

To show you where my implementations are I denote them with:
/**********START OF ANDREW'S IMPLEMENTATION**********/
/**********END OF ANDREW'S IMPLEMENTATION**********/

Sometimes TA's require showing where their comments are in the code, I denote
these with
// TA'S COMMENTS
// END TA'S COMMENTS

Each project also contains a read me on the goal of the project and how to
properly use the program should you choose to try them out.

Enjoy!
