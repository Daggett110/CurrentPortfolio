This project was meant to be teach us about how to construct different heaps 
and use Huffman encoding to turn strings into representations that require less 
storage space. The intended input and output is provided with these files. I 
tested it with these as well as my own name and a few other words. It supports
all lower case letters in the regular english alphabet and spaces.

To try this program, when executing it in the command line, you will need to
enter 3 seperate messages, and the program will repeat those messages and their 
huffman encoded form back to you in the command line.
