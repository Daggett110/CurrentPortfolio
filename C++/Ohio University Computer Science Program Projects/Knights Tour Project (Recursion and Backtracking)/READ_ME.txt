This project was meant to flex our recursion muscles and ensure that we 
understood the concept of backtracking. The idea is that, if the user were to
place a knight somewhere on a chess board, how many possible movesets are 
possible from that location that will allow the knight to visit every spot 
without repeating a spot.

This program takes input through the command line. the intended input was
for the knight to be placed on space (3,3) on a 5x5 board (indexes starting
at 0). This is my reccomended input for the program is to run it with the command
" 3 3" following the execution line. It is the most tested result as it was the
one with the result I was trying to replicate. There is also a data file in here
showing what the intended input and output is for input of 3,3 as a starting location.

The only implementation I had to do in this project was the recursion and
backtracking functionality. View that code in knights_tour.cpp.
